## [0.5.0](https://github.com/LastDragon-ru/lara-asp/compare/0.4.0...0.5.0) (2021-05-16)


### Features

* **graphql:** Added two highly powerful `@searchBy` and `@sortBy`  directives for [lighthouse-php](https://lighthouse-php.com/). The `@searchBy` directive provides basic conditions like `=`, `>`, `<`, etc, relations, `not (<condition>)`, enums, and custom operators support. All are strictly typed so you no need to use `Mixed` type anymore. The `@sortBy` is not only about standard sorting by columns but also allows use relations. ðŸ˜Ž
