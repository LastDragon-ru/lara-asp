# `JsonString`

Represents [JSON](https://json.org) string.

Please note that the scalar doesn't encode/decode value to/from JSON, it just contains a valid JSON string. Consider using `JSON` type from [`mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars`](https://github.com/mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars) package if you need a conversion.
