# `JsonString`

Represents [JSON](https://json.org) string.

By default, the type validates the string and throws an error if it is not a valid JSON. If you are sure that the string is valid JSON, you can return instance of [`JsonStringable`](../../src/Scalars/JsonStringable.php) (or [`JsonString`](../../src/Scalars/JsonString.php)) in this case validation will be omitted.

Please note that the scalar doesn't encode/decode value to/from JSON, it just contains a valid JSON string. If you want automatically convert value to/from JSON, you can use the `JSON` type from [`mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars`](https://github.com/mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars) package. If you need something more typesafe, consider using [`Serializer`](../../../serializer/README.md).
