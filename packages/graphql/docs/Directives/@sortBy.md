# `@sortBy` directive

Probably the most powerful directive to provide sort (`order by` conditions) for your GraphQL queries.

## Basic usage

How to use (and [generated GraphQL schema](../../src/SortBy/Directives/DirectiveTest~example-expected.graphql)):

```graphql
type Query {
    "You can use normal input type"
    users(order: UsersSort @sortBy): ID! @all

    "or `_` to generate type automatically ðŸ˜›"
    comments(order: _ @sortBy): [Comment!]! @all
}

input UsersSort {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}

type Comment {
    text: String
    user: User
}

type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}
```

And:

```graphql
query {
    # ORDER BY user.name ASC, text DESC
    comments(order: [
        {user: {name: asc}}
        {text: desc}
    ])
}
```

## Input type auto-generation

As you can see in the example above you can use the special placeholder `_` instead of real `input`. In this case, `@sortBy` will generate `input` automatically by the actual `type` of the query. While converting `type` into `input` following fields will be excluded:

* unions
* with list/array type
* with `@field` directive
* with `@sortByIgnored` directive
* with any directive that implements [`Ignored`](../../src/SortBy/Contracts/Ignored.php)
* any `Type` that implements [`Ignored`](../../src/SortBy/Contracts/Ignored.php)

## Operators

The package defines only one's own type. To extend/replace the list of its operators, you can use config and/or add directives to scalar/enum inside the schema. Directives is the recommended way and have priority over the config. Please see [`@searchBy`](#type-operators) for examples.

* `SortByExtra` / [`Operators::Extra`](../../src/SortBy/Operators.php) - List of additional extra operators for all types. The list is empty by default.

## Eloquent/Database

### Supported Relations

The main feature - the ability to sort results by relation properties, at the moment supported the following relation types:

* `HasOne` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#one-to-one>)
* `HasMany` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#one-to-many>)
* `HasManyThrough` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#has-many-through>)
* `BelongsTo` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#one-to-many-inverse>)
* `BelongsToMany` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#many-to-many>)
* `MorphOne` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#one-of-many-polymorphic-relations>)
* `MorphMany` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#one-to-many-polymorphic-relations>)
* `MorphToMany` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#many-to-many-polymorphic-relations>)
* `HasOneThrough` (<https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#has-one-through>)

### Order by random

It is also possible to sort records in random order, but it is not enabled by default. To enable it you just need to add [`Random`](../../src/SortBy/Operators/Extra/Random.php)/`@sortByOperatorRandom` operator/directive to `Extra` type:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types = 1);

use LastDragon_ru\LaraASP\GraphQL\Builder\Contracts\Operator;
use LastDragon_ru\LaraASP\GraphQL\SortBy\Operators as SortByOperators;
use LastDragon_ru\LaraASP\GraphQL\SortBy\Definitions\SortByOperatorRandomDirective;

/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * GraphQL Settings
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * @var array{
 *      sort_by: array{
 *          operators: array<string, list<string|class-string<Operator>>>
 *      },
 *      } $settings
 */
$settings = [
    'sort_by'   => [
        'operators' => [
            SortByOperators::Extra => [
                SortByOperatorRandomDirective::class,
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

return $settings;
```

or

```graphql
scalar SortByExtra
@sortByOperatorRandom
```

And after this, you can ðŸŽ‰

```graphql
query {
    # ORDER BY RANDOM()
    comments(order: [
        {random: yes}
    ])
}
```
